# Automate Email Sending Over Logic Apps

## Goal

- Land global contracts with direct response marketing.

## Objectives

- Automate direct response marketing actions.
- Monitor the system.
- Implement a pay-as-you-go system.
- Embed CVs for the first stage of communication.

## Tools

- **Zapier** or **Logic Apps**

## To-Do List

1. **Stop Out of Office Replies**: Configure filters to avoid sending emails to recipients who are out of the office.
2. **Send Emails by Geo**: Use location-based marketing to target specific regions.
3. **Add Attachments and CC Assistant**: Ensure all necessary files are included and assistants are copied in on emails.
4. **Find an Alternative to Zapier**: Explore other automation tools if Zapier does not meet requirements.
5. **Use AI to Enhance Emails**: Integrate AI to make emails more engaging and targeted.
6. **Utilize Email Filters**: Implement email filters to streamline communication and avoid spam.

## Workflow Ideas

- **Automate Responses**: Use Logic Apps to automatically respond based on specific criteria.
- **Error Handling**: Add an exclusion list to filter out unwanted email addresses (e.g., `do-not-reply@technojobs.co.uk`).
- **Monitoring and Debugging**: Set up monitoring for workflows to identify errors and optimize performance.
- **Use Email Attachments Strategically**: Manage and reduce attachment sizes to avoid email failures.
